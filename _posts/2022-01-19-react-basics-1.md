This article will discuss some of the core features of React. I have managed to get a grasp of few concepts within react by making a simple application (A color choser). This article will describe the concepts by explaining how the app was made.

There are four concepts which will be described in this article:

- React functional components
- useState hook
- Controlled input
- Prop drilling

## React functional components

Modern react uses functional components. In making this color chosser application, two components are used which are being imported to the App.js main component. These components are:

- The Box component
- The Input component

# Let's import the stuff we will need
from __future__ import unicode_literals, print_function, division
from io import open
import unicodedata
import string
import re
import random
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch import optim
import torch.nn.functional as F
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
%matplotlib inline

## useState hook

## Controlled input

## Prop drilling
